# Spring Bootcamp Homework1

We were asked to create a simple REST API for a country management system. The API should be able to create, read, update and delete countries. Long story short, CRUD operations. Country model should have the following fields:

➔ id

➔ name

➔ president

While creating dto classes we should use mapstruct library. We should also use lombok library to avoid boilerplate code.

We were free to choose any database we want. I used H2 database. I also used Swagger to document the API.
