 # Spring Bootcamp Homework1 ðŸ“‚

  We were asked to create a simple REST API for a country management system. The API should be able to create, read, update and delete countries. Long story short, CRUD operations. Country model should have the following fields:

  âž” id

  âž” name

  âž” president

  While creating dto classes we should use mapstruct library. We should also use lombok library to avoid boilerplate code.

  We were free to choose any database we want. I used H2 database. I also used Swagger to document the API.
